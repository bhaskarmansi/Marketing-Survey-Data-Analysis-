# Marketing-Survey-Data-Analysis

Welcome to my CodeX Marketing Data Analysis Project Portfolio! In this project, I have undertaken the task of providing valuable insights to the marketing team at CodeX,  a German beverage company, in order to enhance their presence in the Indian market. The primary goal of this project is to leverage survey data from 10 cities in India to drive actionable decisions and strategies.

**Project Overview**

This Project is part of a challenge organized by Codebasics.io wherein CodeX a fictitious company recently launched their energy drink in 10 cities across India and wishes to increase brand awareness, market share, and product development. To achieve these objectives, the marketing team conducted a comprehensive survey, collecting responses from 10,000 individuals in the target cities. As a marketing data analyst, my responsibility was to analyze this survey data and extract meaningful insights that would aid the team in making informed decisions.

**Key Highlights**

Domain: Food & Beverage (F&B)

Function: Marketing

Tools Used: SQL for primary data analysis, Power BI for visualization

**Project Deliverables**

**Data Analysis:** Leveraging SQL, I performed an in-depth analysis of the survey data to uncover patterns, and trends. This analysis helped identify key factors that influence consumer behavior and preferences in the F&B industry.

**Visualization:** To present the findings effectively, I utilized Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. The visualizations include interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs to explore the data and gain a comprehensive understanding of the results.
