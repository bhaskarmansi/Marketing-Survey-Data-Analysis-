# Marketing-Survey-Data-Analysis

Welcome to my CodeX Marketing Data Analysis Project Portfolio! In this project, I have undertaken the task of providing valuable insights to the marketing team at CodeX,  a German beverage company, in order to enhance their presence in the Indian market. The primary goal of this project is to leverage survey data from 10 cities in India to drive actionable decisions and strategies.

Project Overview
This Project is part of a challenge organized by Codebasics.io wherein CodeX a fictious company recently launched their energy drink in 10 cities across India and wishes to increase brand awareness, market share, and product development. To achieve these objectives, the marketing team conducted a comprehensive survey, collecting responses from 10,000 individuals in the target cities. As a marketing data analyst, my responsibility was to analyze this survey data and extract meaningful insights that would aid the team in making informed decisions.
